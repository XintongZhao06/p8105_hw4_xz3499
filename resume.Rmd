### Work Experience

### Smartphone Supply Chain Business Assistant
**Xiaomi Communications Co., Ltd.** - Beijing, China  
*May 2024 – Aug 2024*

- Developed and deployed a multiple linear regression model in R to analyze and predict beauty algorithm pricing, reducing reliance on manual estimates.
- Fitted the model using historical data (2018-2023) and implemented regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting to enable accurate price predictions for new beauty algorithms, and performed sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of feature coefficients on price forecasts.
- Employed R to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical procurement data, including last procurement prices (LP), cost analysis prices (CA), competitor prices (CP), and market prices (MP).
- Developed and trained a predictive pricing model, applied cross-validation techniques to assess model performance, and optimized weight distribution to ensure that target prices were closely aligned with actual transaction prices.

### Research Experience

#### Analysis of COVID-19 Transmission Dynamics Based on SIR Model
**3-Person Project, instructed by R. Todd Ogden, Columbia University**  
*Jul 2024 – Oct 2024*

- Preprocessed dataset from Johns Hopkins CSSE (Jan 2020 - Mar 2023) with confirmed, death, and recovered cases from 20 countries.
- Utilized Random Forest, GBM, and XGBoost models for predictions, achieving high performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²).
- Applied SHAP values to interpret machine learning model predictions and elucidate feature rankings.
- Employed optimization techniques including model simplification, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

#### Enhancing Relational Data Quality through Traditional and AI-Based Cleaning Techniques
**2-Person Project, instructed by Yu Sun, Database and Information System Lab, NKU**  
*Sep 2023 – Aug 2024*

- Conducted extensive literature review on traditional and AI-based methods for relational data cleaning.
- Focused on three essential tasks: error detection, data repairing, and data imputation.
- Analyzed and compared effectiveness of traditional signal-based methods and AI techniques across five dimensions.
- Explored integration of deep learning and machine learning techniques in data cleaning systems.
